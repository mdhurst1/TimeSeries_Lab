    "In this lab you will run a simple time series analysis for the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in Earth's atmosphere recorded at the [Mauna Loa Observatory](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/) on Hawaii (run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the USA). The analysis has been written for you in the Python computer programming language, but **you don't need any prior knowledge of computer programming**. The aims of this lab are:\n",
    "* Understand what a time series is\n",
    "* Familiarise yourself with important concepts in time series analysis\n",
    "* Examine the changing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere through time\n",

No prior knowledge of programming is required for this lab. **Learning how to be a programmer is not the aim!** However, this sort of scientific computing is becoming more common place in research and consultancy, so it won't do you any harm to see it in action. Python is a multifunctional computer language, for example it can interface with ArcGIS and QGIS (the software used in the previous lab) to automate workflows.\n",

    "An asterisk in square brackets `In [*]:` will appear while the code is being executed, and this will change to a number `In [1]:` when the code is finished. *The order in which you execute the code blocks matters, they must be run in sequence.* \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside blocks of python code there are comments indicated by lines that start with `#`. These lines are not computer code but rather comments providing information about what the code is doing to help you follow along.
